# 🧠 I Build Systems That Think Before They Act

I'm **Peter Gebri** – CEO, CTO, and system designer with 25 years of development experience. I'm the creator of two systems that aren't just running — they're reshaping how we think about data and decision-making:

## 🔥 Hydra – The Adaptive Intelligent Data Engine

Hydra is not a database. Hydra is a **paradigm shift**.

It's the first **adaptive, intelligent data engine** designed to turn developer intent into real-time, reactive memory — without indexes, without background jobs, without garbage. Hydra doesn’t search. It knows.

After 3+ years of deep engineering, **Hydra will debut publicly in Q2 2025** as an open-source, **enterprise-grade foundation** for the next generation of reactive systems.

## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m a full-stack system architect obsessed with building things that **vanish when not needed, react without delay**, and scale without bloat.\
My daily stack includes **Go**, **Angular**, and the **Hydra architecture**, where every decision is intentional.
